1. The term System-1 inference refers to direct prediction via a trained/adapted neural network whereas System-2 inference typically refers to a neuro-symbolic approach to reasoning. Which of the following do you agree with:

 (a) System-1 involves more costly inference than System-2 False

✓(b) System-2 involves more costly inference than System-1 True

✓(c) System-1 involves more training cost than System-2 True

 (d) System 2 involves more training cost than System-1 False

Score: 5.0

2. Which of the following statements regarding "model stacking":

 (a) Stacking is the same as adding more layers to a deep neural network False

✓(b) Stacking uses the predictions of one model as features for another model True

✓(c) Stacking is a form of ensemble learning related to bagging False

✓(d) Stacking is a form of ensemble learning related to boosting True

Score: 2.5

3. What would you agree with regarding a language model trained using next-token prediction vs one trained using a meta-learning objective:

 (a) A model training using next-token prediction is always better than one trained using meta-learning. False

 (b) A model training using next-token prediction is always worse than one trained using meta-learning False

✓(c) The behaviour of a model trained using next-toke prediction relies on in-context learning for few-shot tasks True

 (d) The behaviour of a model trained using a meta-learning objective is exactly equivalent to applying one-step of gradient descent on few-shot examples False

Score: 5.0
