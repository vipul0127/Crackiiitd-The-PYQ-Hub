- **Website:** [Crackiiitd.in](https://crackiiitd.in)
## Summary

CrackIIITD is a centralized, student-friendly platform built to simplify access to past year question papers (PYQs) at IIIT-Delhi. By integrating with Google Classroom and using automation techniques, the platform gathers and organizes question papers across all courses and years — solving the age-old “where are the PYQs?” problem for students.

## The Story Behind

During my 2nd semester, I noticed how every student at IIITD struggles with finding PYQs when exams approach. While they are essential for preparation, they are scattered across Google Drives, WhatsApp chats, and Telegram groups. Many of these links get deleted or lost.

So, I created CrackIIITD — a hub where students can **search, browse, and access all PYQs with just a few clicks**, backed by automation and smart file handling.
